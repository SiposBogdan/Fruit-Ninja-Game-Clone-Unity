# Fruit Ninja Clone Game Unity

This project is a simplified Fruit Ninja clone built with Unity and C#. It features core gameplay elements like 
random fruit spawning, real-time swipe detection for slicing and live score tracking. The game uses Unityâ€™s 
physics engine to create smooth slicing animations and realistic fruit reactions, enhanced by sound effects for a 
more immersive experience.
